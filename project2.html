        <p>The sentimental analysis has been implemented with the SVM and CBOW 
            algorithm. It is the continuation of the research work named as “WhatsApp group chat 
            analysis by using machine learning”. The active participants of the WhatsApp group and 
            also the influenced person have been identified by using decision tree and Naïve Bayesian 
            algorithm with better accuracy. 
            The classification accuracy achieved using the Machine Learning Algorithms such 
            as Decision Tree is 98.48 % and Naïve Bayesian is 95.45 %. By implementing SVM and 
            CBOW for analysing book reviews, classification accuracy results obtained is 82.1% and 
            89%.
            In future, it is planned to implement types of Convolutional Neural Network 
            architectures and Long Short-Term Memory for sentimental analysis on medicinal products 
            reviews.
