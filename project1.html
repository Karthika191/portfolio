        <p>Recently WhatsApp is commonly used to share information from one person to another. WhatsApp plays a major role
            in internet-based communication. The main goal of this study is to present a detailed analysis of the WhatsApp group
            messages and identify the people, who are very active in that WhatsApp group. The dataset will be retrieved from the
            Kaggle repository and the analysis will be done for determining the type of message that the people prefer in most
            group chats, and check the most activeday of the week, and to find out which age group people are more active. The
            data analysis stage involves the process of cleaning, inspecting, and modeling the data that will be used for this
            system. Machine Learning algorithms like regression will be implemented for the analysis and result interpretation.
            Google Collaboratory is used for implementation. Main goal is </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To find the influenced person</li>
            <li>Most used words in their discussion</li>
            <li>Visualization of chat statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Impact: This analysis can be used for social research, user behavior analysis, and improving group communication dynamics.</p>
